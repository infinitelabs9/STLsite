Project Topic: Movie Collection
General Overview:
We decided to create this app because it's an excellent opportunity for us to get more comfortable with PHP and databases, and it allows us to implement CRUD functionality. Additionally, we find the idea of a movie collection app both interesting and engaging to work on.

App Purpose:
The goal of the app is to let users manage their personal movie collections, enabling them to rate movies, mark them as watched or unwatched, and organize their collection according to various criteria.

App Features:
Create: Add new movies to your collection.
Read: Display a list of all movies in the collection.
Update: Modify movie details such as ratings, genres, or descriptions.
Delete: Remove movies from the collection.
Search and Filter: Offer advanced search and filter options (e.g., by genre, year, rating). Allow users to sort the movie list by various criteria (e.g., release date, rating).
